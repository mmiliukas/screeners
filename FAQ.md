## What does +/- signs mean ?

+/- sign identifies increase and/or decrease of a metric from a previous run.
Runs can happen multiple times per day/hour/minute. Each time it's a diff/delta from a previous run.

## What does +/- next to stock/ticker symbol means ?

```
Loosers 1    456  -1         -VJET
