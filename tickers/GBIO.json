The company develops cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) platform, a modular delivery system for nucleic acids to avoid off-target clearance by the liver and spleen that enables ctLNPs to persist in systemic circulation, which allows for highly selective and potent ligand-driven targeting to specific tissues and cell types; and novel immune-quiet DNA (iqDNA) to enable long-lasting high levels of gene expression from non-integrating episomes and avoids innate immune sensors that have long prevented DNA from use in non-viral systems. It uses its platform for developing a portfolio of programs for treating cancer, autoimmune, hematologic disorders, prioritizing sickle cell, beta-thalassemia, and hemophilia A diseases, as well as for other tissues and cell types, including retina, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system. The company was formerly known as Torus Therapeutics, Inc. and changed its name to Generation Bio Co. in November 2017. Generation Bio Co. was incorporated in 2016 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.", "fullTimeEmployees": 174, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Cameron Geoffrey McDonough M.D.", "age": 53, "title": "President, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1970, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 1013383, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Mark D.
