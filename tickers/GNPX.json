The company's technologies are designed to administer disease-fighting genes to provide new therapies for patient populations with cancer and diabetes. Its oncology program utilizes its systemic, non-viral Oncoprex Delivery System, which encapsulates the gene-expressing plasmids using lipid-based nanoparticles in a lipoplex form. The company's lead product candidate, Reqorsa Immunogene Therapy (quaratusugene ozeplasmid), is being evaluated in three clinical trials as a treatment for NSCLC and SCLC. Its three lung cancer clinical programs have received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of that patient population, and SCLC program has received an FDA Orphan Drug Designation. The company's diabetes gene therapy comprises of a novel infusion process that uses an AAV vector to deliver Pdx1 and MafA genes directly to the pancreas. In models of Type 1 diabetes, its GPX-002 transforms alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which produce insulin but distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body's immune system; and GPX-002 for Type 2 diabetes, where autoimmunity is not at play, is believed to rejuvenate and replenish exhausted beta cells. Genprex, Inc. was incorporated in 2009 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas.", "fullTimeEmployees": 21, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Mark S.
