The company's technologies are designed to administer disease-fighting genes to provide new therapies for patient populations with cancer and diabetes. Its oncology program utilizes its systemic, non-viral Oncoprex Delivery System, which encapsulates the gene-expressing plasmids using lipid-based nanoparticles in a lipoplex form. The company's lead product candidate, Reqorsa Immunogene Therapy (quaratusugene ozeplasmid), is being evaluated in three clinical trials as a treatment for NSCLC and SCLC. Its three lung cancer clinical programs have received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of that patient population, and SCLC program has received an FDA Orphan Drug Designation. The company's diabetes gene therapy comprises of a novel infusion process that uses an AAV vector to deliver Pdx1 and MafA genes directly to the pancreas. In models of Type 1 diabetes, its GPX-002 transforms alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which produce insulin but distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body's immune system; and GPX-002 for Type 2 diabetes, where autoimmunity is not at play, is believed to rejuvenate and replenish exhausted beta cells. Genprex, Inc. was incorporated in 2009 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas.", "fullTimeEmployees": 26, "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 2.04, "open": 2.082, "dayLow": 2.02, "dayHigh": 2.14, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 2.04, "regularMarketOpen": 2.082, "regularMarketDayLow": 2.02, "regularMarketDayHigh": 2.14, "beta": -0.534, "forwardPE": -0.74538743, "volume": 32118, "regularMarketVolume": 32118, "averageVolume": 106801, "averageVolume10days": 43090, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 43090, "marketCap": 4239374, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 2.01, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 42.0, "fiftyDayAverage": 2.40372, "twoHundredDayAverage": 7.50298, "currency": "USD", "enterpriseValue": -3977745, "floatShares": 2086085, "sharesOutstanding": 2098700, "sharesShort": 39356, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 49674, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1713139200, "dateShortInterest": 1715731200, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.0188, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.01672, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.068169996, "shortRatio": 1.24, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.019, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 2098700, "bookValue": 4.555, "priceToBook": 0.44346872, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1703980800, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1711843200, "netIncomeToCommon": -27626556, "trailingEps": -18.81, "forwardEps": -2.71, "lastSplitFactor": "1:40", "lastSplitDate": 1706832000, "enterpriseToEbitda": 0.143, "52WeekChange": -0.9318489, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.26238096, "exchange": "NCM", "quoteType": "EQUITY", "symbol": "GNPX", "underlyingSymbol": "GNPX", "shortName": "Genprex, Inc.", "longName": "Genprex, Inc.", "firstTradeDateEpochUtc": 1522330200, "timeZoneFullName": "America/New_York", "timeZoneShortName": "EDT", "uuid": "d506e914-dc7c-30af-b5b9-638e83c34981", "messageBoardId": "finmb_225557674", "gmtOffSetMilliseconds": -14400000, "currentPrice": 2.02, "targetHighPrice": 320.0, "targetLowPrice": 10.0, "targetMeanPrice": 165.0, "targetMedianPrice": 165.0, "recommendationMean": 2.0, "recommendationKey": "buy", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 2, "totalCash": 8217115, "totalCashPerShare": 3.915, "ebitda": -27794076, "quickRatio": 2.158, "currentRatio": 2.423, "returnOnAssets": -0.96865, "returnOnEquity": -2.02827, "freeCashflow": -13021066, "operatingCashflow": -23104056, "financialCurrency": "USD", "trailingPegRatio": null, "__fetch_time": "2024-06-24"}]
