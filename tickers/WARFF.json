As one of the 30 constituent stocks in the original Hang Seng Index from the 1960s, Wharf is backed by a long standing mission of \u0093Building for Tomorrow\u0094 and a proven track record in management and execution. After spinning off Wharf Real Estate Investment Company Limited as a separately-listed company (Stock Code: 1997) in 2017, the Group's businesses currently comprise Investment Properties, Hotels and Development Properties in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Other businesses include Logistics Infrastructure through Modern Terminals and Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals. The Group's exclusive Peak Portfolio, comprising a rare collection of unique properties, continues to feature the highest bespoke quality and craftsmanship catering to the demands of a discerning clientele that does not buy in \u0093off plans\u0094 presale. The development profile is characterised by attention to details, generous development cost, long payback period and high capital intensity. In Mainland Investment Properties, starting from a small nascent base some 20 years ago, the Group's proactive efforts are beginning to bear fruit in order to realise plans to generate a proper return over the next 20 to 30 years remaining on the majority of the underlying land leases. However, market dynamics have changed and competition has significantly stiffened. The Mainland Development Properties land bank at the end of June 2022 was 1.94 million square metres. Strict price control and other regulatory policies have depressed selling prices and increased investment risk. The Group has become more selective with new land acquisition. At the same time, the Group's land bank has been marked to market, which is however still undergoing correction. Wharf Hotels manages 16 hotels, with over 5,000 rooms and suites, in Mainland China, Hong Kong and the Philippines. Niccolo Suzhou, opened in April 2021, was the fifth addition to the luxury Niccolo Hotels brand, with the other 11 hotels under the foundation Marco Polo Hotels brand. The Group owns three of these hotels and a fourth through a 50/50 joint venture. The Group also owns and operates Modern Terminals and is a founding partner in Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, key components in Hong Kong's success as an international trade and transportation hub for decades. \u0093Building for Tomorrow\u0094 also extends to Wharf's \u0093Business-in-Community\u0094 (\u0093BIC\u0094) commitment. Flagship school improvement programme \u0093Project WeCan\u0094 grows from strength to strength along with a series of BIC initiatives, with an aim of helping different segments of society in Hong Kong and the Mainland.", "fullTimeEmployees": 5700, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Hoi Ng  Tin", "age": 71, "title": "Chairman & MD", "yearBorn": 1952, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 1918765, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Yiu Cheung  Tsui C.P.A., CGA, CGA-Canada, CGMA, FCCA, FCIS, FCMA, F", "age": 76, "title": "Executive Vice Chairman & Group CFO", "yearBorn": 1947, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 1063460, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Yen Thean  Leng B.Sc., BSc (Hons), MHKIS, MRICS, RPS", "age": 52, "title": "Executive Director", "yearBorn": 1971, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 750587, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Chung Ying  Hui C.P.A., FCCA, FCIS, FCS, HKICPA", "age": 66, "title": "Company Secretary & Director", "yearBorn": 1957, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 500904, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Hon.
