The company's products under development include Latozinemab (AL001), an investigational human recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin (PGRN), a protein encoded by the granulin (GRN) gene that regulates lysosomal function, neuronal survival, and inflammation in the brain. Its lead PGRN-elevating candidate is being developed for the potential treatment of frontotemporal dementia with a granulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN) which is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the GRN gene and results in PGRN haploinsufficiency and is in Phase 3 clinical trial. It also develops AL101/GSK4527226 that is in Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, the company's preclinical and research pipeline products include ADP037-ABC, a proprietary anti-amyloid beta (A\u00df) antibody paired with proprietary ABC for the treatment of AD; ADP050-ABC, a GCase replacement therapy paired with proprietary ABC for GBA gene mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia; ADP056, a Reelin modulator designed to block tau pathology and promote synaptic function in AD; and ADP063-ABC and ADP064-ABC that are therapeutic candidates paired with proprietary ABC that target tau pathology in AD through distinct approaches. It has a strategic collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc for the development and commercialization of progranulin-elevating monoclonal antibodies, including latozinemab and AL101 to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 238, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Arnon  Rosenthal Ph.D.", "age": 68, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1956, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 888566, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Saraswati  Kenkare-Mitra Ph.D.", "age": 56, "title": "President and Head of Research & Development", "yearBorn": 1968, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 1184681, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Marc  Grasso M.D.", "age": 50, "title": "CFO, Principal Financial Officer & Principal Accounting Officer", "yearBorn": 1974, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 703249, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "auditRisk": 5, "boardRisk": 2, "compensationRisk": 8, "shareHolderRightsRisk": 8, "overallRisk": 6, "governanceEpochDate": 1743465600, "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1735603200, "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 1.18, "open": 1.18, "dayLow": 1.135, "dayHigh": 1.195, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 1.18, "regularMarketOpen": 1.18, "regularMarketDayLow": 1.135, "regularMarketDayHigh": 1.195, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 0.734, "forwardPE": -0.7702702, "volume": 452265, "regularMarketVolume": 452265, "averageVolume": 697673, "averageVolume10days": 932370, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 932370, "bid": 0.8496, "ask": 1.45, "bidSize": 2, "askSize": 2, "marketCap": 116921816, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.87, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 6.78, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 1.1627301, "fiftyDayAverage": 1.34204, "twoHundredDayAverage": 3.36796, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": -257920080, "profitMargins": -1.18388, "floatShares": 73332475, "sharesOutstanding": 99085904, "sharesShort": 5579363, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 5346593, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1741910400, "dateShortInterest": 1744675200, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.0563, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.10614, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.81813, "shortRatio": 9.09, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0797, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 102563000, "bookValue": 1.28, "priceToBook": 0.890625, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1767139200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1735603200, "netIncomeToCommon": -119049000, "trailingEps": -1.23, "forwardEps": -1.48, "enterpriseToRevenue": -2.565, "enterpriseToEbitda": 1.877, "52WeekChange": -0.78326994, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.07995045, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 1.14, "targetHighPrice": 8.56, "targetLowPrice": 1.0, "targetMeanPrice": 4.22286, "targetMedianPrice": 4.0, "recommendationMean": 2.11111, "recommendationKey": "buy", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 7, "totalCash": 413396992, "totalCashPerShare": 4.172, "ebitda": -137384992, "totalDebt": 42519000, "quickRatio": 3.306, "currentRatio": 3.397, "totalRevenue": 100558000, "debtToEquity": 33.532, "revenuePerShare": 1.041, "returnOnAssets": -0.16373, "returnOnEquity": -0.9124, "grossProfits": -85382000, "freeCashflow": -89851000, "operatingCashflow": -229904992, "revenueGrowth": 2.571, "grossMargins": -0.84907997, "ebitdaMargins": -1.36623, "operatingMargins": -0.13365, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "ALEC", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "cryptoTradeable": false, "shortName": "Alector, Inc.", "longName": "Alector, Inc.", "hasPrePostMarketData": true, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChange": 0.26999998, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChangePercent": 0.31034482, "fiftyTwoWeekRange": "0.87 -
