The company's products under development include Latozinemab (AL001), an investigational human recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin (PGRN), a protein encoded by the granulin (GRN) gene that regulates lysosomal function, neuronal survival, and inflammation in the brain. Its lead PGRN-elevating candidate is being developed for the potential treatment of frontotemporal dementia with a granulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN) which is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the GRN gene and results in PGRN haploinsufficiency and is in Phase 3 clinical trial. It also develops AL101/GSK4527226 that is in Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, the company's preclinical and research pipeline products include ADP037-ABC, a proprietary anti-amyloid beta (A\u00df) antibody paired with proprietary ABC for the treatment of AD; ADP050-ABC, a GCase replacement therapy paired with proprietary ABC for GBA gene mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia; ADP056, a Reelin modulator designed to block tau pathology and promote synaptic function in AD; and ADP063-ABC and ADP064-ABC that are therapeutic candidates paired with proprietary ABC that target tau pathology in AD through distinct approaches. It has a strategic collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc for the development and commercialization of progranulin-elevating monoclonal antibodies, including latozinemab and AL101 to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 175, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Arnon  Rosenthal Ph.D.", "age": 68,
