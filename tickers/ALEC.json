The company's products under development include Latozinemab (AL001), an investigational human recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin (PGRN), a protein encoded by the granulin (GRN) gene that regulates lysosomal function, neuronal survival, and inflammation in the brain. Its lead PGRN-elevating candidate is being developed for the potential treatment of frontotemporal dementia with a granulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN) which is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the GRN gene and results in PGRN haploinsufficiency and is in Phase 3 clinical trial. It also develops AL101/GSK4527226 that is in Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, the company's preclinical and research pipeline products include ADP037-ABC, a proprietary anti-amyloid beta (A\u00df) antibody paired with proprietary ABC for the treatment of AD; ADP050-ABC, a GCase replacement therapy paired with proprietary ABC for GBA gene mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia; ADP056, a Reelin modulator designed to block tau pathology and promote synaptic function in AD; and ADP063-ABC and ADP064-ABC that are therapeutic candidates paired with proprietary ABC that target tau pathology in AD through distinct approaches. It has a strategic collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc for the development and commercialization of progranulin-elevating monoclonal antibodies, including latozinemab and AL101 to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 163, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Arnon  Rosenthal Ph.D.", "age": 68, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1956, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 888566, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Saraswati  Kenkare-Mitra Ph.D.", "age": 56, "title": "President and Head of Research & Development", "yearBorn": 1968, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 1184681, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Neil  Berkley M.B.A., M.S.", "age": 50, "title": "Interim CFO & Chief Business Officer", "yearBorn": 1974, "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Katie  Hogan", "title": "Senior Director of Corporate Communication & Investor Relations", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Danielle  Pasqualone J.D., Ph.D.", "title": "General Counsel", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Clare  Hunt M.B.A.", "title": "Chief People Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Kristina  Cutter M.P.H.", "title": "Chief Regulatory, Pharmacovigilance, & Quality Assurance Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Virginia  DeJesus-Rueff M.B.A.", "title": "Chief of Staff & Head of Strategy", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Giacomo  Salvadore M.D.", "title": "Chief Medical Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "auditRisk": 6, "boardRisk": 4, "compensationRisk": 8, "shareHolderRightsRisk": 8, "overallRisk": 6, "governanceEpochDate": 1761955200, "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1735603200, "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 1.3, "open": 1.27, "dayLow": 1.17, "dayHigh": 1.29, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 1.3, "regularMarketOpen": 1.27, "regularMarketDayLow": 1.17, "regularMarketDayHigh": 1.29, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 0.659, "forwardPE": -0.8648648, "volume": 1975326, "regularMarketVolume": 1975326, "averageVolume": 2597985, "averageVolume10days": 3653730, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 3653730, "bid": 1.25, "ask": 1.31, "bidSize": 2, "askSize": 7, "marketCap": 139713888, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.87, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 6.14, "allTimeHigh": 43.32, "allTimeLow": 0.87, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 1.722099, "fiftyDayAverage": 2.6153, "twoHundredDayAverage": 1.785235, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": -136220976, "profitMargins": -1.42104, "floatShares": 84573022, "sharesOutstanding": 109151472, "sharesShort": 5166162, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 5841774, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1757894400, "dateShortInterest": 1760486400, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.051, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.10343, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.76816005, "shortRatio": 4.62, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0643, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 102793772, "bookValue": 1.28, "priceToBook": 1.0, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1767139200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1751241600, "netIncomeToCommon": -115289000, "trailingEps": -1.06, "forwardEps": -1.48, "enterpriseToRevenue": -1.679, "enterpriseToEbitda": 1.077, "52WeekChange": -0.78547853, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.1198014, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 1.28, "targetHighPrice": 5.0, "targetLowPrice": 1.0, "targetMeanPrice": 2.2, "targetMedianPrice": 1.5, "recommendationMean": 3.22222, "recommendationKey": "hold", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 5, "totalCash": 307280000, "totalCashPerShare": 3.036, "ebitda": -126438000, "totalDebt": 39483000, "quickRatio": 3.643, "currentRatio": 3.784, "totalRevenue": 81130000, "debtToEquity": 55.473, "revenuePerShare": 0.82, "returnOnAssets": -0.17838, "returnOnEquity": -1.03985, "grossProfits": -74581000, "freeCashflow": -98126376, "operatingCashflow": -215591008, "revenueGrowth": -0.478, "grossMargins": -0.91928, "ebitdaMargins": -1.5584599, "operatingMargins": -4.3355303, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "ALEC", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "postMarketChangePercent": -0.9140559, "postMarketPrice": 1.2683, "postMarketChange": -0.011699915, "regularMarketChange": -0.02, "regularMarketDayRange": "1.17 -
