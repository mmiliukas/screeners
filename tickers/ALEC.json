The company's products under development include Latozinemab (AL001), an investigational human recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin (PGRN), a protein encoded by the granulin (GRN) gene that regulates lysosomal function, neuronal survival, and inflammation in the brain. Its lead PGRN-elevating candidate is being developed for the potential treatment of frontotemporal dementia with a granulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN) which is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the GRN gene and results in PGRN haploinsufficiency and is in Phase 3 clinical trial. It also develops AL101/GSK4527226 that is in Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, the company's preclinical and research pipeline products include ADP037-ABC, a proprietary anti-amyloid beta (A\u00df) antibody paired with proprietary ABC for the treatment of AD; ADP050-ABC, a GCase replacement therapy paired with proprietary ABC for GBA gene mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia; ADP056, a Reelin modulator designed to block tau pathology and promote synaptic function in AD; and ADP063-ABC and ADP064-ABC that are therapeutic candidates paired with proprietary ABC that target tau pathology in AD through distinct approaches. It has a strategic collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc for the development and commercialization of progranulin-elevating monoclonal antibodies, including latozinemab and AL101 to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 175, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Arnon  Rosenthal Ph.D.", "age": 68, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1956, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 888566, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Saraswati  Kenkare-Mitra Ph.D.", "age": 56, "title": "President and Head of Research & Development", "yearBorn": 1968, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 1184681, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Neil  Berkley M.B.A., M.S.", "age": 50, "title": "Interim CFO & Chief Business Officer", "yearBorn": 1974, "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Katie  Hogan", "title": "Senior Director of Corporate Communication & Investor Relations", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Danielle  Pasqualone J.D., Ph.D.", "title": "General Counsel", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Clare  Hunt M.B.A.", "title": "Chief People Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Kristina  Cutter M.P.H.", "title": "Chief Regulatory, Pharmacovigilance, & Quality Assurance Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Virginia  DeJesus-Rueff M.B.A.", "title": "Chief of Staff & Head of Strategy", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Giacomo  Salvadore M.D.", "title": "Chief Medical Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "auditRisk": 6, "boardRisk": 4, "compensationRisk": 8, "shareHolderRightsRisk": 8, "overallRisk": 6, "governanceEpochDate": 1748736000, "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1735603200, "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 1.72, "open": 1.69, "dayLow": 1.6, "dayHigh": 1.705, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 1.72, "regularMarketOpen": 1.69, "regularMarketDayLow": 1.6, "regularMarketDayHigh": 1.705, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 0.721, "forwardPE": -1.0878378, "volume": 227831, "regularMarketVolume": 227831, "averageVolume": 870586, "averageVolume10days": 618990, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 618990, "bid": 1.56, "ask": 1.67, "bidSize": 4, "askSize": 4, "marketCap": 160988080, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.87, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 6.78, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 1.8223896, "fiftyDayAverage": 1.3786, "twoHundredDayAverage": 2.29246, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": -173513360, "profitMargins": -1.39736, "floatShares": 73907530, "sharesOutstanding": 99992600, "sharesShort": 6372729, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 5365193, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1747267200, "dateShortInterest": 1749772800, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.0637, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.09947, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.80823, "shortRatio": 6.32, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0806, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 106824000, "bookValue": 0.946, "priceToBook": 1.7019027, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1767139200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1743379200, "netIncomeToCommon": -123441000, "trailingEps": -1.26, "forwardEps": -1.48, "enterpriseToRevenue": -1.964, "enterpriseToEbitda": 1.25, "52WeekChange": -0.7190227, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.1116153, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 1.61, "targetHighPrice": 10.0, "targetLowPrice": 1.0, "targetMeanPrice": 4.65143, "targetMedianPrice": 4.0, "recommendationKey": "none", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 7, "totalCash": 354551008, "totalCashPerShare": 3.546, "ebitda": -138831008, "totalDebt": 41048000, "quickRatio": 3.23, "currentRatio": 3.34, "totalRevenue": 88339000, "debtToEquity": 43.387, "revenuePerShare": 0.902, "returnOnAssets": -0.17218, "returnOnEquity": -0.90262, "grossProfits": -86075000, "freeCashflow": -92860872, "operatingCashflow": -229342000, "revenueGrowth": -0.769, "grossMargins": -0.97436994, "ebitdaMargins": -1.5715699, "operatingMargins": -12.165219, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "ALEC", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "shortName": "Alector, Inc.", "longName": "Alector, Inc.", "regularMarketChangePercent": -6.39535, "regularMarketPrice": 1.61, "postMarketChangePercent": 0.0, "postMarketPrice": 1.61, "postMarketChange": 0.0, "regularMarketChange": -0.11, "regularMarketDayRange": "1.6 -
