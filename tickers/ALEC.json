The company's products under development include Latozinemab (AL001), an investigational human recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin (PGRN), a protein encoded by the granulin (GRN) gene that regulates lysosomal function, neuronal survival, and inflammation in the brain. Its lead PGRN-elevating candidate is being developed for the potential treatment of frontotemporal dementia with a granulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN) which is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the GRN gene and results in PGRN haploinsufficiency and is in Phase 3 clinical trial. It also develops AL101/GSK4527226 that is in Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, the company's preclinical and research pipeline products include ADP037-ABC, a proprietary anti-amyloid beta (A\u00df) antibody paired with proprietary ABC for the treatment of AD; ADP050-ABC, a GCase replacement therapy paired with proprietary ABC for GBA gene mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia; ADP056, a Reelin modulator designed to block tau pathology and promote synaptic function in AD; and ADP063-ABC and ADP064-ABC that are therapeutic candidates paired with proprietary ABC that target tau pathology in AD through distinct approaches. It has a strategic collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc for the development and commercialization of progranulin-elevating monoclonal antibodies, including latozinemab and AL101 to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 156, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Arnon  Rosenthal Ph.D.", "age": 69, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1956, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 888566, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Neil  Berkley M.B.A., M.S.", "age": 51, "title": "CFO & Chief Business Officer", "yearBorn": 1974, "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Katie  Hogan", "title": "Senior Director of Corporate Communication & Investor Relations", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Danielle  Pasqualone J.D., Ph.D.", "title": "General Counsel", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Clare  Hunt M.B.A.", "title": "Chief People & Places Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Kristina  Cutter M.P.H.", "title": "Chief Development Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Giacomo  Salvadore M.D.", "title": "Chief Medical Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Hua  Long DABT, Ph.D.", "title": "Senior VP & Head of Research", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "auditRisk": 6, "boardRisk": 4, "compensationRisk": 8, "shareHolderRightsRisk": 8, "overallRisk": 6, "governanceEpochDate": 1768176000, "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1735603200, "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 1.91, "open": 1.878, "dayLow": 1.81, "dayHigh": 1.9, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 1.91, "regularMarketOpen": 1.878, "regularMarketDayLow": 1.81, "regularMarketDayHigh": 1.9, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 0.609, "forwardPE": -1.9894737, "volume": 1191181, "regularMarketVolume": 1191181, "averageVolume": 1423701, "averageVolume10days": 862310, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 862310, "bid": 1.36, "ask": 2.34, "bidSize": 2, "askSize": 2, "marketCap": 206296288, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.87, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 3.4, "allTimeHigh": 43.32, "allTimeLow": 0.87, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 2.9877229, "fiftyDayAverage": 1.524, "twoHundredDayAverage": 1.788535, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": -46936716, "profitMargins": -1.56031, "floatShares": 78193932, "sharesOutstanding": 109151472, "sharesShort": 6489706, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 6319929, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1765756800, "dateShortInterest": 1768435200, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.059499998, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.099379994, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.824, "shortRatio": 5.55, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0736, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 109151472, "bookValue": 0.537, "priceToBook": 3.519553, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1767139200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1759190400, "netIncomeToCommon": -107736000, "trailingEps": -1.06, "forwardEps": -0.95, "enterpriseToRevenue": -0.68, "enterpriseToEbitda": 0.406, "52WeekChange": 0.16463411, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.16255379, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 1.89, "targetHighPrice": 5.0, "targetLowPrice": 0.9, "targetMeanPrice": 2.1, "targetMedianPrice": 1.25, "recommendationKey": "none", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 4, "totalCash": 291108000, "totalCashPerShare": 2.667, "ebitda": -115693000, "totalDebt": 37875000, "quickRatio": 3.64, "currentRatio": 3.757, "totalRevenue": 69048000, "debtToEquity": 65.628, "revenuePerShare": 0.689, "returnOnAssets": -0.17838, "returnOnEquity": -1.2198, "grossProfits": -116892000, "freeCashflow": -94395128, "operatingCashflow": -197368000, "revenueGrowth": -0.788, "grossMargins": -1.69291, "ebitdaMargins": -1.67554, "operatingMargins": -11.5362, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "ALEC", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "hasPrePostMarketData": true, "firstTradeDateMilliseconds": 1549549800000, "cryptoTradeable": false, "marketState": "CLOSED", "postMarketChangePercent": 0.0, "postMarketPrice": 1.89, "postMarketChange": 0.0, "regularMarketChange": -0.01999998, "regularMarketDayRange": "1.81 -
