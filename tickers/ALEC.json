The company's products under development include Latozinemab (AL001), an investigational human recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin (PGRN), a protein encoded by the granulin (GRN) gene that regulates lysosomal function, neuronal survival, and inflammation in the brain. Its lead PGRN-elevating candidate is being developed for the potential treatment of frontotemporal dementia with a granulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN) which is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the GRN gene and results in PGRN haploinsufficiency and is in Phase 3 clinical trial. It also develops AL101/GSK4527226 that is in Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, the company's preclinical and research pipeline products include ADP037-ABC, a proprietary anti-amyloid beta (A\u00df) antibody paired with proprietary ABC for the treatment of AD; ADP050-ABC, a GCase replacement therapy paired with proprietary ABC for GBA gene mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia; ADP056, a Reelin modulator designed to block tau pathology and promote synaptic function in AD; and ADP063-ABC and ADP064-ABC that are therapeutic candidates paired with proprietary ABC that target tau pathology in AD through distinct approaches. It has a strategic collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc for the development and commercialization of progranulin-elevating monoclonal antibodies, including latozinemab and AL101 to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 156, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Arnon  Rosenthal Ph.D.", "age": 68, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1956, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 888566, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Saraswati  Kenkare-Mitra Ph.D.", "age": 56, "title": "President and Head of Research & Development", "yearBorn": 1968, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 1184681, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Neil  Berkley M.B.A., M.S.", "age": 50, "title": "Interim CFO & Chief Business Officer", "yearBorn": 1974, "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Katie  Hogan", "title": "Senior Director of Corporate Communication & Investor Relations", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Danielle  Pasqualone J.D., Ph.D.", "title": "General Counsel", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Clare  Hunt M.B.A.", "title": "Chief People Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Kristina  Cutter M.P.H.", "title": "Chief Regulatory, Pharmacovigilance, & Quality Assurance Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Virginia  DeJesus-Rueff M.B.A.", "title": "Chief of Staff & Head of Strategy", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Giacomo  Salvadore M.D.", "title": "Chief Medical Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "auditRisk": 6, "boardRisk": 4, "compensationRisk": 8, "shareHolderRightsRisk": 8, "overallRisk": 6, "governanceEpochDate": 1761955200, "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1735603200, "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 1.35, "open": 1.35, "dayLow": 1.3, "dayHigh": 1.35, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 1.35, "regularMarketOpen": 1.35, "regularMarketDayLow": 1.3, "regularMarketDayHigh": 1.35, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 0.659, "forwardPE": -0.8986487, "volume": 566885, "regularMarketVolume": 566885, "averageVolume": 2681211, "averageVolume10days": 1580110, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 1580110, "bid": 1.29, "ask": 1.36, "bidSize": 9, "askSize": 9, "marketCap": 145171456, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.87, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 3.4, "allTimeHigh": 43.32, "allTimeLow": 0.87, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 2.1024716, "fiftyDayAverage": 2.1987, "twoHundredDayAverage": 1.754035, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": -108061544, "profitMargins": -1.56031, "floatShares": 78243050, "sharesOutstanding": 109151472, "sharesShort": 5424705, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 5166162, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1760486400, "dateShortInterest": 1763078400, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.0497, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.10118, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.82094, "shortRatio": 1.12, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0615, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 109151472, "bookValue": 0.537, "priceToBook": 2.4767227, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1767139200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1759190400, "netIncomeToCommon": -107736000, "trailingEps": -1.06, "forwardEps": -1.48, "enterpriseToRevenue": -1.565, "enterpriseToEbitda": 0.934, "52WeekChange": -0.4621514, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.1265819, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 1.33, "targetHighPrice": 5.0, "targetLowPrice": 0.75, "targetMeanPrice": 2.05, "targetMedianPrice": 1.5, "recommendationMean": 3.11111, "recommendationKey": "hold", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 5, "totalCash": 291108000, "totalCashPerShare": 2.667, "ebitda": -115693000, "totalDebt": 37875000, "quickRatio": 3.64, "currentRatio": 3.757, "totalRevenue": 69048000, "debtToEquity": 65.628, "revenuePerShare": 0.689, "returnOnAssets": -0.17838, "returnOnEquity": -1.2198, "grossProfits": -116892000, "freeCashflow": -94395128, "operatingCashflow": -197368000, "revenueGrowth": -0.788, "grossMargins": -1.69291, "ebitdaMargins": -1.67554, "operatingMargins": -11.5362, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "ALEC", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "regularMarketPrice": 1.33, "marketState": "CLOSED", "longName": "Alector, Inc.", "shortName": "Alector, Inc.", "priceEpsCurrentYear": -0.9328686, "fiftyDayAverageChange": -0.8686999, "fiftyDayAverageChangePercent": -0.39509708, "twoHundredDayAverageChange": -0.42403495, "twoHundredDayAverageChangePercent": -0.24174829, "sourceInterval": 15, "exchangeDataDelayedBy": 0, "averageAnalystRating": "3.1 -
