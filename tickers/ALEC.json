The company's products under development include Latozinemab (AL001), an investigational human recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin (PGRN), a protein encoded by the granulin (GRN) gene that regulates lysosomal function, neuronal survival, and inflammation in the brain. Its lead PGRN-elevating candidate is being developed for the potential treatment of frontotemporal dementia with a granulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN) which is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the GRN gene and results in PGRN haploinsufficiency and is in Phase 3 clinical trial. It also develops AL101/GSK4527226 that is in Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, the company's preclinical and research pipeline products include ADP037-ABC, a proprietary anti-amyloid beta (A\u00df) antibody paired with proprietary ABC for the treatment of AD; ADP050-ABC, a GCase replacement therapy paired with proprietary ABC for GBA gene mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia; ADP056, a Reelin modulator designed to block tau pathology and promote synaptic function in AD; and ADP063-ABC and ADP064-ABC that are therapeutic candidates paired with proprietary ABC that target tau pathology in AD through distinct approaches. It has a strategic collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc for the development and commercialization of progranulin-elevating monoclonal antibodies, including latozinemab and AL101 to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 156, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Arnon  Rosenthal Ph.D.", "age": 68, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1956, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 888566, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "auditRisk": 6, "boardRisk": 4, "compensationRisk": 8, "shareHolderRightsRisk": 8, "overallRisk": 6, "governanceEpochDate": 1764547200, "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1735603200, "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 1.45, "open": 1.44, "dayLow": 1.4025, "dayHigh": 1.475, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 1.45, "regularMarketOpen": 1.44, "regularMarketDayLow": 1.4025, "regularMarketDayHigh": 1.475, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 0.666, "forwardPE": -1.7938219, "volume": 640188, "regularMarketVolume": 640188, "averageVolume": 2759288, "averageVolume10days": 1610230, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 1610230, "bid": 1.01, "ask": 1.76, "bidSize": 2, "askSize": 2, "marketCap": 158269632, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.87, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 3.4, "allTimeHigh": 43.32, "allTimeLow": 0.87, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 2.2921681, "fiftyDayAverage": 1.5299, "twoHundredDayAverage": 1.72481, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": -94963368, "profitMargins": -1.56031, "floatShares": 78193932, "sharesOutstanding": 109151472, "sharesShort": 6319929, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 5424705, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1763078400, "dateShortInterest": 1765756800, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.0579, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.099379994, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.82137, "shortRatio": 3.72, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0716, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 109151472, "bookValue": 0.537, "priceToBook": 2.7001863, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1767139200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1759190400, "netIncomeToCommon": -107736000, "trailingEps": -1.06, "forwardEps": -0.80833, "enterpriseToRevenue": -1.375, "enterpriseToEbitda": 0.821, "52WeekChange": -0.15697676, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.17354333, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 1.45, "targetHighPrice": 5.0, "targetLowPrice": 0.75, "targetMeanPrice": 2.0625, "targetMedianPrice": 1.25, "recommendationMean": 3.125, "recommendationKey": "hold", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 4, "totalCash": 291108000, "totalCashPerShare": 2.667, "ebitda": -115693000, "totalDebt": 37875000, "quickRatio": 3.64, "currentRatio": 3.757, "totalRevenue": 69048000, "debtToEquity": 65.628, "revenuePerShare": 0.689, "returnOnAssets": -0.17838, "returnOnEquity": -1.2198, "grossProfits": -116892000, "freeCashflow": -94395128, "operatingCashflow": -197368000, "revenueGrowth": -0.788, "grossMargins": -1.69291, "ebitdaMargins": -1.67554, "operatingMargins": -11.5362, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "ALEC", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "corporateActions": [], "postMarketTime": 1766783403, "regularMarketTime": 1766782801, "exchange": "NMS", "messageBoardId": "finmb_249249899", "exchangeTimezoneName": "America/New_York", "exchangeTimezoneShortName": "EST", "gmtOffSetMilliseconds": -18000000, "market": "us_market", "esgPopulated": false, "postMarketChangePercent": 0.0, "postMarketPrice": 1.45, "postMarketChange": 0.0, "regularMarketChange": 0.0, "regularMarketDayRange": "1.4025 - 1.475", "fullExchangeName": "NasdaqGS", "averageDailyVolume3Month": 2759288, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChange": 0.58000004, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChangePercent": 0.6666667, "fiftyTwoWeekRange": "0.87 - 3.4", "fiftyTwoWeekHighChange": -1.95, "fiftyTwoWeekHighChangePercent": -0.5735294, "fiftyTwoWeekChangePercent": -15.697676, "earningsTimestamp": 1762462800, "earningsTimestampStart": 1762462800, "earningsTimestampEnd": 1762462800, "earningsCallTimestampStart": 1754598600, "earningsCallTimestampEnd": 1754598600, "isEarningsDateEstimate": false, "epsTrailingTwelveMonths": -1.06, "epsForward": -0.80833, "epsCurrentYear": -1.425, "priceEpsCurrentYear": -1.0175439, "fiftyDayAverageChange": -0.07989991, "fiftyDayAverageChangePercent": -0.052225575, "twoHundredDayAverageChange": -0.27480996, "twoHundredDayAverageChangePercent": -0.15932767, "sourceInterval": 15, "exchangeDataDelayedBy": 0, "averageAnalystRating": "3.1 - Hold", "shortName": "Alector, Inc.", "longName": "Alector, Inc.", "marketState": "CLOSED", "cryptoTradeable": false, "regularMarketChangePercent": 0.0, "regularMarketPrice": 1.45, "hasPrePostMarketData": true, "firstTradeDateMilliseconds": 1549549800000, "displayName": "Alector", "trailingPegRatio": null, "__fetch_time": "2025-12-27"}]
