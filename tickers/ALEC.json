The company's products under development include Latozinemab (AL001), an investigational human recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin (PGRN), a protein encoded by the granulin (GRN) gene that regulates lysosomal function, neuronal survival, and inflammation in the brain. Its lead PGRN-elevating candidate is being developed for the potential treatment of frontotemporal dementia with a granulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN) which is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the GRN gene and results in PGRN haploinsufficiency and is in Phase 3 clinical trial. It also develops AL101/GSK4527226 that is in Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, the company's preclinical and research pipeline products include ADP037-ABC, a proprietary anti-amyloid beta (A\u00df) antibody paired with proprietary ABC for the treatment of AD; ADP050-ABC, a GCase replacement therapy paired with proprietary ABC for GBA gene mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia; ADP056, a Reelin modulator designed to block tau pathology and promote synaptic function in AD; and ADP063-ABC and ADP064-ABC that are therapeutic candidates paired with proprietary ABC that target tau pathology in AD through distinct approaches. It has a strategic collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc for the development and commercialization of progranulin-elevating monoclonal antibodies, including latozinemab and AL101 to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 163, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Arnon  Rosenthal Ph.D.", "age": 68, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1956, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 888566, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Saraswati  Kenkare-Mitra Ph.D.", "age": 56, "title": "President and Head of Research & Development", "yearBorn": 1968, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 1184681, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Neil  Berkley M.B.A., M.S.", "age": 50, "title": "Interim CFO & Chief Business Officer", "yearBorn": 1974, "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Katie  Hogan", "title": "Senior Director of Corporate Communication & Investor Relations", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Danielle  Pasqualone J.D., Ph.D.", "title": "General Counsel", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Clare  Hunt M.B.A.", "title": "Chief People Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Kristina  Cutter M.P.H.", "title": "Chief Regulatory, Pharmacovigilance, & Quality Assurance Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Virginia  DeJesus-Rueff M.B.A.", "title": "Chief of Staff & Head of Strategy", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Giacomo  Salvadore M.D.", "title": "Chief Medical Officer", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "auditRisk": 6, "boardRisk": 4, "compensationRisk": 8, "shareHolderRightsRisk": 8, "overallRisk": 6, "governanceEpochDate": 1756684800, "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1735603200, "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 2.93, "open": 2.94, "dayLow": 2.92, "dayHigh": 3.155, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 2.93, "regularMarketOpen": 2.94, "regularMarketDayLow": 2.92, "regularMarketDayHigh": 3.155, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 0.996, "forwardPE": -2.0945945, "volume": 1022212, "regularMarketVolume": 1022212, "averageVolume": 1102258, "averageVolume10days": 1060060, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 1060060, "bid": 3.05, "ask": 3.12, "bidSize": 10, "askSize": 10, "marketCap": 313758208, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.87, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 6.14, "allTimeHigh": 43.32, "allTimeLow": 0.87, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 3.8673513, "fiftyDayAverage": 2.3234, "twoHundredDayAverage": 1.705935, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": 45961220, "profitMargins": -1.42104, "floatShares": 84573022, "sharesOutstanding": 101212329, "sharesShort": 5841774, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 5472802, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1755216000, "dateShortInterest": 1757894400, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.0577, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.10373, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.77121, "shortRatio": 4.49, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0728, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 101212329, "bookValue": 0.703, "priceToBook": 4.4096727, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1767139200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1751241600, "netIncomeToCommon": -115289000, "trailingEps": -1.16, "forwardEps": -1.48, "enterpriseToRevenue": 0.567, "enterpriseToEbitda": -0.364, "52WeekChange": -0.33476394, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.1529237, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 3.1, "targetHighPrice": 10.0, "targetLowPrice": 1.0, "targetMeanPrice": 3.83333, "targetMedianPrice": 2.75, "recommendationMean": 2.11111, "recommendationKey": "buy", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 6, "totalCash": 307280000, "totalCashPerShare": 3.036, "ebitda": -126438000, "totalDebt": 39483000, "quickRatio": 3.643, "currentRatio": 3.784, "totalRevenue": 81130000, "debtToEquity": 55.473, "revenuePerShare": 0.82, "returnOnAssets": -0.17838, "returnOnEquity": -1.03985, "grossProfits": -74581000, "freeCashflow": -98126376, "operatingCashflow": -215591008, "revenueGrowth": -0.478, "grossMargins": -0.91928, "ebitdaMargins": -1.5584599, "operatingMargins": -4.3355303, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "ALEC", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "fullExchangeName": "NasdaqGS", "averageDailyVolume3Month": 1102258, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChange": 2.23, "averageAnalystRating": "2.1 -
