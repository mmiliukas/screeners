The company's SupraAntigen and Morphomer platforms are designed to generate biologics and small molecules, which selectively interact with misfolded proteins that are common in a range of neurodegenerative diseases. It develops Crenezumab, a humanized, conformation specific monoclonal antibody used to slow Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression; and Semorinemab, an investigational monoclonal anti Tau antibody that targets the N-terminal portion of the Tau protein and is designed to bind to Tau and slow its spread between neurons for the treatment of AD. The company is also developing ACI-24.060 for the treatment of down syndrome related AD; ACI-7104.056 to treat Parkinson's disease; and ACI-35.030, designs to stimulate a patient's immune system to produce antibodies against pathological phosphorylated Tau. In addition, it develops diagnostic programs consisting of PI-2620, a Tau diagnostic for AD, as well as non-AD Tauopathies; and ACI-12589, a-sync PET tracer that supports the differential diagnosis of multiple system atrophy from other neurodegenerative disease. Further, the company is researching and developing Morphomer Tau aggregation inhibitors to evaluate candidates in AD; Morphomer a-syn to compete with small molecule inhibitors of a-syn aggregation; and NeuroOrphan Tauopathies. Additionally, it generates discovery and preclinical stage molecules targeting range of neurodegenerative diseases, which include diagnostics targeting TDP-43, alpha-synuclein, and NLRP3. The company has license agreements and collaborations with Genentech, Inc.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Life Molecular Imaging SA; and Eli Lilly and Company. AC Immune SA was incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland.", "fullTimeEmployees": 133, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Andrea  Pfeifer Ph.D.", "age": 67, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1957, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 1452924, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Christopher  Roberts", "age": 34, "title": "CFO & VP of Finance", "yearBorn": 1990, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Piergiorgio  Donati", "age": 53, "title": "Chief Technical Operations Officer", "yearBorn": 1971, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Howard  Donovan", "age": 48, "title": "Chief HR Officer", "yearBorn": 1976, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Gary Anthony Waanders Ph.D.", "age": 60, "title": "Senior VP of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications", "yearBorn": 1964, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Matthias  Maurer Ph.D.", "title": "SVP & General Counsel", "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Oliver  Sol M.D.", "age": 56, "title": "VP & Head of Clinical Development", "yearBorn": 1968, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Julien  Rongere Ph.D.", "age": 45, "title": "Senior Vice President of Regulatory Affairs & Quality Assurance", "yearBorn": 1979, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Mark  Danton", "age": 60, "title": "Executive Vice President of Information Systems & Artificial Intelligence", "yearBorn": 1964, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Anke  Post M.D., Ph.D.", "age": 57, "title": "Chief Medical Officer", "yearBorn": 1967, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1703980800, "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 1.66, "open": 1.68, "dayLow": 1.61, "dayHigh": 1.7, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 1.66, "regularMarketOpen": 1.68, "regularMarketDayLow": 1.61, "regularMarketDayHigh": 1.7, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 1.616, "forwardPE": -6.76, "volume": 38247, "regularMarketVolume": 38247, "averageVolume": 189095, "averageVolume10days": 147920, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 147920, "bid": 1.19, "ask": 2.07, "bidSize": 2, "askSize": 2, "marketCap": 169692912, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 1.43, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 4.978, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 5.996428, "fiftyDayAverage": 1.9268, "twoHundredDayAverage": 2.8279, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": 26239574, "profitMargins": -1.8404499, "floatShares": 40182589, "sharesOutstanding": 100410000, "sharesShort": 1448743, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 1349062, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1741910400, "dateShortInterest": 1744675200, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.014400001, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.38006002, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.26482, "shortRatio": 7.21, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0305, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 100410000, "bookValue": 0.944, "priceToBook": 1.7902542, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1767139200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1743379200, "netIncomeToCommon": -52083000, "trailingEps": -0.63, "forwardEps": -0.25, "enterpriseToRevenue": 0.927, "enterpriseToEbitda": -0.522, "52WeekChange": -0.293617, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.08001411, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 1.69, "targetHighPrice": 12.018479, "targetLowPrice": 7.6742625, "targetMeanPrice": 9.145894, "targetMedianPrice": 8.445417, "recommendationMean": 1.25, "recommendationKey": "strong_buy", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 4, "totalCash": 145614000, "totalCashPerShare": 1.45, "ebitda": -50223000, "totalDebt": 5175000, "quickRatio": 1.497, "currentRatio": 1.533, "totalRevenue": 28299000, "debtToEquity": 5.459, "revenuePerShare": 0.283, "returnOnAssets": -0.17074, "returnOnEquity": -0.43497002, "grossProfits": -35022000, "freeCashflow": 57573624, "operatingCashflow": 46002000, "grossMargins": -1.23757, "ebitdaMargins": -1.7747301, "operatingMargins": -19.56566, "financialCurrency": "CHF", "symbol": "ACIU", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "marketState": "REGULAR", "hasPrePostMarketData": true, "firstTradeDateMilliseconds": 1474637400000, "regularMarketChange": 0.03000009, "regularMarketDayRange": "1.61 -
