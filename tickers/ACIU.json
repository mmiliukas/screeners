The company's SupraAntigen and Morphomer platforms are designed to generate biologics and small molecules, which selectively interact with misfolded proteins that are common in a range of neurodegenerative diseases. It is developing Crenezumab, a humanized, conformation-specific monoclonal antibody used to slow Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression; and Semorinemab, an investigational monoclonal anti-Tau antibody that targets the N-terminal portion of the Tau protein and is designed to bind to Tau and slow its spread between neurons for the treatment of AD. The company is also developing ACI-24.060 for the treatment of down syndrome-related AD; ACI-7104.056, to treat Parkinson's disease; and ACI-35.030, designs to stimulate a patient's immune system to produce antibodies against pathological phosphorylated Tau. In addition, it is developing diagnostic programs, consisting of PI-2620, a Tau diagnostic for AD, as well as non-AD Tauopathies; and ACI-12589, a-sync PET tracer that supports the differential diagnosis of multiple system atrophy from other neurodegenerative disease. Further, the company is researching and developing Morphomer Tau aggregation inhibitors to evaluate candidates in AD and NeuroOrphan Tauopathies. Additionally, it has discovery and preclinical stage molecules targeting range of neurodegenerative diseases, which include diagnostics targeting TDP-43, alpha-synuclein, and NLRP3. The company has license agreements and collaborations with Genentech, Inc.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Life Molecular Imaging SA; and Eli Lilly and Company. AC Immune SA was incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland.", "fullTimeEmployees": 133, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Andrea  Pfeifer Ph.D.", "age": 66, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1957, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 1425600, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Christopher  Roberts", "age": 33, "title": "CFO & VP of Finance", "yearBorn": 1990, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Piergiorgio  Donati", "age": 52, "title": "Chief Technical Operations Officer", "yearBorn": 1971, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Jean-Fabien  Monin", "age": 52, "title": "Chief Administrative Officer", "yearBorn": 1971, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Howard  Donovan", "age": 47, "title": "Chief HR Officer", "yearBorn": 1976, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Nuno  Mendonca M.D.", "age": 41, "title": "Chief Medical Officer", "yearBorn": 1982, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Madiha  Derouazi", "age": 50, "title": "Chief Scientific Officer", "yearBorn": 1973, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Gary Anthony Waanders Ph.D.", "age": 59, "title": "Senior VP of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications", "yearBorn": 1964, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Alexandre  Caratsch", "age": 57, "title": "General Counsel", "yearBorn": 1966, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Julian  Snow", "title": "VP of U.S. Finance & Corporate Development", "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1703980800, "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 3.69, "open": 3.7, "dayLow": 3.64, "dayHigh": 3.71, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 3.69, "regularMarketOpen": 3.7, "regularMarketDayLow": 3.64, "regularMarketDayHigh": 3.71, "beta": 1.243, "forwardPE": -14.192308, "volume": 104897, "regularMarketVolume": 104897, "averageVolume": 155469, "averageVolume10days": 96840, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 96840, "bid": 3.65, "ask": 3.69, "bidSize": 100, "askSize": 100, "marketCap": 365089728, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 2.2, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 5.14, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 23.572426, "fiftyDayAverage": 3.4386, "twoHundredDayAverage": 3.50635, "currency": "USD", "enterpriseValue": 195444160, "floatShares": 40608399, "sharesOutstanding": 98940304, "sharesShort": 756028, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 938339, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1722384000, "dateShortInterest": 1724976000, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.0076, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.41981, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.2919, "shortRatio": 6.69, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0143, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 99693104, "bookValue": 1.24, "priceToBook": 2.9758065, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1703980800, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1719705600, "netIncomeToCommon": -60509000, "trailingEps": -0.76, "forwardEps": -0.26, "enterpriseToRevenue": 12.619, "enterpriseToEbitda": -3.344, "52WeekChange": 0.2341137, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.31472707, "exchange": "NGM", "quoteType": "EQUITY", "symbol": "ACIU", "underlyingSymbol": "ACIU", "shortName": "AC Immune SA", "longName": "AC Immune SA", "firstTradeDateEpochUtc": 1474637400, "timeZoneFullName": "America/New_York", "timeZoneShortName": "EDT", "uuid": "85843cf1-545c-39be-aeb0-e49af7d9f82e", "messageBoardId": "finmb_22309440", "gmtOffSetMilliseconds": -14400000, "currentPrice": 3.69, "targetHighPrice": 15.94, "targetLowPrice": 7.97, "targetMeanPrice": 10.21, "targetMedianPrice": 8.46, "recommendationMean": 1.2, "recommendationKey": "strong_buy", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 4, "totalCash": 175124000, "totalCashPerShare": 1.759, "ebitda": -58439000, "totalDebt": 3229000, "quickRatio": 1.757, "currentRatio": 1.796, "totalRevenue": 15488000, "debtToEquity": 2.616, "revenuePerShare": 0.167, "returnOnAssets": -0.19058001, "returnOnEquity": -0.46058, "freeCashflow": 59121248, "operatingCashflow": 44560000, "grossMargins": -2.8322601, "operatingMargins": -30.51092, "financialCurrency": "CHF", "trailingPegRatio": null, "__fetch_time": "2024-09-23"}]
