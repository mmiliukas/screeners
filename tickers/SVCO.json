The company's TCAD software are used in various applications, such as physical etch and deposition process simulation; calibration of doping profiles and metal oxide semiconductor/bipolar transistors; modeled effects; photonics simulation for solar cell, charge-coupled device (CCD), metal oxide semiconductor image sensor, thin-film transistor (TFT), liquid crystal display, and organic light-emitting diode using ray tracing/finite-difference time domain/timing memory; single event effect and total dose simulation; and stress simulation. Its EDA software solution covers various areas of analog/mixed-signal/radiofrequency circuit simulation; and custom integrated circuits CAD and interconnect modeling, including support for CMOS, bipolar, diode, junction-gate field-effect transistor, silicon on insulator, TFT, high-electron mobility transistor, insulated-gate bipolar transistor, and resistor and capacitor models, as well as provides SPICE modeling services for the semiconductor industry. The company also provides SIP and EDA software and design services, such as standard cell library development; IP migration to new process; embedded memory compilers, such as static random-access memories, read only memories, and register files; library characterization services; and general purpose and custom I/Os. Further, the company provides SIP management tools and SIP. It serves semiconductor manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, and original design manufacturers that deploys solutions in production flows across various target markets, including display, power devices, automotive, memory, high performance compute, Internet of Things, and 5G/6G mobile markets in the United States and internationally. The company was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 267, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Babak A.
