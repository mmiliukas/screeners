It operates through three segments: Therapeutic DNA Production Services; MDx Testing Services; and DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services. The Therapeutic DNA Production Services segment develops and commercializes the LinearDNA platform, which enables a cell-free manufacture of high-fidelity synthetic DNA sequences for use in nucleic acid-based therapeutics. The MDx Testing Services segment provides clinical molecular diagnostics (MDx) testing and clinical laboratory testing services; COVID-19 testing services, including test scheduling, sample collection, and automated results reporting for higher education institutions, private clients, and businesses under the safeCircle trademark; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for production and detection of DNA and RNA; and MDx test kits and related supplies, as well as Isotopic analysis testing services. The DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services segment offers SigNature Molecular Tags, which provides a methodology to authenticate goods within large and complex supply chains for materials, such as cotton, nutraceuticals, and other products; SigNify portable DNA readers and SigNify consumable reagent test kits; and fiberTyping, which uses PCR-based DNA detection to detect a product's naturally occurring DNA sequences for the purposes of product provenance authentication and supply chain security. The company was formerly known as Datalink Systems, Inc. and changed its name to Applied DNA Sciences, Inc. in 2002. The company was founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Stony Brook, New York.", "fullTimeEmployees": 46, "companyOfficers": [], "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 4.515, "open": 4.81, "dayLow": 4.71, "dayHigh": 5.05, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 4.515, "regularMarketOpen": 4.81, "regularMarketDayLow": 4.71, "regularMarketDayHigh": 5.05, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 0.047, "trailingPE": 0.0012945764, "forwardPE": -4.644231, "volume": 49686, "regularMarketVolume": 49686, "averageVolume": 92688, "averageVolume10days": 68270, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 68270, "bid": 4.66, "ask": 5.02, "bidSize": 1, "askSize": 1, "marketCap": 2506770, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 4.35, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 2655.0, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 0.6613094, "fiftyDayAverage": 8.8614, "twoHundredDayAverage": 157.96335, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": -4494359, "profitMargins": -1.94178, "floatShares": 429001, "sharesOutstanding": 519000, "sharesShort": 104263, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 52501, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1747267200, "dateShortInterest": 1749772800, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.2009, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.027590001, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.04118, "shortRatio": 0.82, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.2009, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 519000, "bookValue": 24.781, "priceToBook": 0.19490738, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1727654400, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1759190400, "mostRecentQuarter": 1743379200, "netIncomeToCommon": -46187184, "trailingEps": 3730.95, "forwardEps": -1.04, "lastSplitFactor": "1:15", "lastSplitDate": 1748822400, "enterpriseToRevenue": -1.186, "enterpriseToEbitda": 0.355, "52WeekChange": -0.9882909, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.12748289, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 4.83, "recommendationKey": "none", "totalCash": 6823260, "totalCashPerShare": 15.751, "ebitda": -12655340, "totalDebt": 472390, "quickRatio": 3.966, "currentRatio": 4.45, "totalRevenue": 3790616, "debtToEquity": 4.62, "revenuePerShare": 77.518, "returnOnAssets": -0.73407, "returnOnEquity": -1.4865601, "grossProfits": 1545085, "freeCashflow": -9414620, "operatingCashflow": -13254834, "revenueGrowth": 0.058, "grossMargins": 0.40761003, "ebitdaMargins": 0.0, "operatingMargins": -3.5203202, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "APDN", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "shortName": "Applied DNA Sciences, Inc.", "longName": "Applied DNA Sciences, Inc.", "hasPrePostMarketData": true, "firstTradeDateMilliseconds": 1058275800000, "postMarketChangePercent": 1.44928, "postMarketPrice": 4.9, "postMarketChange": 0.0700002, "regularMarketChange": 0.31500006, "regularMarketDayRange": "4.71 - 5.05", "fullExchangeName": "NasdaqCM", "averageDailyVolume3Month": 92688, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChange": 0.48000002, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChangePercent": 0.110344835, "fiftyTwoWeekRange": "4.35 - 2655.0", "fiftyTwoWeekHighChange": -2650.17, "fiftyTwoWeekHighChangePercent": -0.99818075, "fiftyTwoWeekChangePercent": -98.829094, "dividendDate": 1572566400, "earningsTimestamp": 1747339200, "earningsTimestampStart": 1754477940, "earningsTimestampEnd": 1754913600, "earningsCallTimestampStart": 1739482200, "earningsCallTimestampEnd": 1739482200, "isEarningsDateEstimate": true, "epsTrailingTwelveMonths": 3730.95, "epsForward": -1.04, "epsCurrentYear": -359.99982, "priceEpsCurrentYear": -0.013416673, "fiftyDayAverageChange": -4.0313997, "fiftyDayAverageChangePercent": -0.4549394, "twoHundredDayAverageChange": -153.13335, "twoHundredDayAverageChangePercent": -0.9694233, "sourceInterval": 15, "exchangeDataDelayedBy": 0, "cryptoTradeable": false, "corporateActions": [], "postMarketTime": 1751065812, "regularMarketTime": 1751054400, "exchange": "NCM", "messageBoardId": "finmb_4324922", "exchangeTimezoneName": "America/New_York", "exchangeTimezoneShortName": "EDT", "gmtOffSetMilliseconds": -14400000, "market": "us_market", "esgPopulated": false, "marketState": "CLOSED", "regularMarketChangePercent": 6.976746, "regularMarketPrice": 4.83, "displayName": "Applied DNA Sciences", "trailingPegRatio": null, "__fetch_time": "2025-06-28"}]
