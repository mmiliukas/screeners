It applies its ProTide technology to transform prescribed chemotherapy agents and nucleoside analogs into medicines. The company, through its technology, is developing ProTides medicines to overcome the limitations of nucleoside analogs and generate much higher concentrations of anti-cancer metabolites in cancer cells. Its pipeline includes NUC-3373, a chemical entity derived from the nucleoside analog 5-fluorouracil that is in Phase 1b/2 study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, Phase 2 clinical trial for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer, and Phase 1b/2 modular clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors and lung cancer. It is also developing NUC-7738, a ProTide transformation of 3'-deoxyadenosine, which is in the Phase 2 part of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors. The company has an assignment, license, and collaboration agreement with Cardiff ProTides Ltd to discover, drug design, and in vitro screen purine and pyrimidine-based nucleosides as potential drug candidates. The company was formerly known as NuCana BioMed Limited and changed its name to NuCana plc in August 2017. NuCana plc was incorporated in 1997 and is headquartered in Edinburgh, the United Kingdom.", "fullTimeEmployees": 20, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Hugh Stephen Griffith", "age": 56, "title": "Founder, CEO & Executive Director", "yearBorn": 1968, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 865286, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. David  Harrison", "age": 64, "title": "Head of Translational Medicine & Studies", "yearBorn": 1960, "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Jeffrey D.
