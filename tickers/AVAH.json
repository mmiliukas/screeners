Its patient-centered care delivery platform allows patients to remain in their homes and minimizes the overutilization of high-cost care settings, such as hospitals or skilled nursing facilities. The company operates through three segments: Private Duty Services (PDS), Home Health & Hospice (HHH), and Medical Solutions (MS). The PDS segment offers PDN services, which include in-home skilled nursing services to medically fragile children and adults; nursing services in school settings in which its caregivers accompany patients to school; services to patients in its pediatric day healthcare centers; and employer of record support and personal care services, as well as in-clinic and home-based therapy services, such as physical, occupational, and speech services. The HHH segment provides home health services, including in-home skilled nursing services; physical, occupational, and speech therapy services; and medical social and aide services, as well as hospice services for patients and their families when a life-limiting illness no longer responds to cure-oriented treatments. The MS segment offers enteral nutrition supplies and other products, including formulas, supplies, and pumps to adults and children delivered on a periodic or as-needed basis. The company was incorporated in 2016 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.", "fullTimeEmployees": 33500, "auditRisk": 10, "boardRisk": 10, "compensationRisk": 6, "shareHolderRightsRisk": 6, "overallRisk": 9, "governanceEpochDate": 1717200000, "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 2.55, "open": 2.55, "dayLow": 2.51, "dayHigh": 2.63, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 2.55, "regularMarketOpen": 2.55, "regularMarketDayLow": 2.51, "regularMarketDayHigh": 2.63, "beta": 2.066, "volume": 177447, "regularMarketVolume": 177447, "averageVolume": 87093, "averageVolume10days": 79550, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 79550, "bid": 2.5, "ask": 2.6, "bidSize": 100, "askSize": 100, "marketCap": 492490240, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.85, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 3.07, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 0.25657898, "fiftyDayAverage": 2.4904, "twoHundredDayAverage": 2.17835, "currency": "USD", "enterpriseValue": 1953786496, "forwardPE": "Infinity", "profitMargins": -0.05923, "floatShares": 44893496, "sharesOutstanding": 192379008, "sharesShort": 1177202, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 1041363, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1713139200, "dateShortInterest": 1715731200, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.0061000003, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.0583, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.88491994, "shortRatio": 15.67, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0228, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 199168992, "bookValue": -0.697, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1703894400, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1735516800, "mostRecentQuarter": 1711756800, "netIncomeToCommon": -113698000, "trailingEps": -0.6, "pegRatio": -5.85, "enterpriseToRevenue": 1.018, "enterpriseToEbitda": 15.495, "52WeekChange": 0.37634408, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.26238096, "exchange": "NMS", "quoteType": "EQUITY", "symbol": "AVAH", "underlyingSymbol": "AVAH", "shortName": "Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc", "longName": "Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc.", "firstTradeDateEpochUtc": 1619616600, "timeZoneFullName": "America/New_York", "timeZoneShortName": "EDT", "uuid": "335dc19e-48ce-3031-b79f-87f91d49927e", "messageBoardId": "finmb_575366670", "gmtOffSetMilliseconds": -14400000, "currentPrice": 2.56, "targetHighPrice": 3.0, "targetLowPrice": 1.7, "targetMeanPrice": 2.64, "targetMedianPrice": 2.75, "recommendationMean": 3.1, "recommendationKey": "hold", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 5, "totalCash": 42607000, "totalCashPerShare": 0.221, "ebitda": 126090000, "totalDebt": 1503904000, "quickRatio": 0.786, "currentRatio": 0.88, "totalRevenue": 1919448960, "revenuePerShare": 10.062, "returnOnAssets": 0.042729996, "freeCashflow": -13900000, "operatingCashflow": 3205000, "revenueGrowth": 0.052, "grossMargins": 0.31093, "ebitdaMargins": 0.065689996, "operatingMargins": 0.0466, "financialCurrency": "USD", "trailingPegRatio": null, "__fetch_time": "2024-06-24"}]
