(\u0093Highlands\u0094), which was formed in December 2015, is a Maryland corporation with a portfolio of investment properties including multi-family, retail and office properties, a correctional facility and unimproved land. Prior to April 28, 2016, Highlands was a wholly-owned subsidiary of InvenTrust Properties Corp. (\u0093InvenTrust\u0094 and formerly known as Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc.), its former parent. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms \u0093we,\u0094 \u0093our\u0094 and \u0093us\u0094 and references to the \u0093Company\u0094 refer to Highlands and its consolidated subsidiaries. On April 28, 2016, Highlands was spun-off from InvenTrust through a pro rata distribution by InvenTrust of 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the \u0093Common Stock\u0094), of Highlands to holders of record of InvenTrust's common stock as of the close of business on April 25, 2016 (the \u0093Record Date\u0094). Each holder of record of InvenTrust's common stock received one share of Common Stock for every one share of InvenTrust's common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date (the \u0093Distribution\u0094). As a result, Highlands became an independent, self-advised, non-listed public company. Highlands has elected to be taxed, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust (\u0093REIT\u0094) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094) for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with Highlands' short taxable year ending December 31, 2016. Each investment property is owned by a separate legal entity which maintains its own books and financial records, and each entity's assets are not available to satisfy the liabilities of other affiliated entities. With the exception of one investment property we own through a variable interest entity with a third-party partner (the \u0093Corvue Venture\u0094), we are the sole owner of each of these separate legal entities. As of March 31, 2025, we have an approximate 95% interest in the Corvue Venture and have funded equity contributions to the Corvue Venture in the approximate amount of $10,200. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company owned 18 investment properties and one parcel of unimproved land.", "fullTimeEmployees": 8, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Robert J.
