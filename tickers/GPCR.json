Its lead product candidate is GSBR-1290, an oral and biased small molecule agonist of glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor, which is in two phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of obesity, overweight, and related conditions. The company also develops ACCG-2671, which is in preclinical trial to treat obesity; ANPA-0073, an oral small molecule agonist targeting the apelin, which is phase 2 ready for selective weight loss or muscle-sparing weight loss; and LTSE-2578, an antagonist that targets lysophosphatidic acid 1 receptor, a G-protein coupled receptors implicated in responses to tissue injury and pro-fibrotic processes, for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, it develops programs, including glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) program, which identified multiple GIPR agonist, dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist, and GIPR antagonist hits for small molecule GIPR modulation that has the potential to provide a treatment in obesity; and GCG program, which identified multiple GCG receptor (GCGR) agonist and dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonist hits for small molecule GCGR modulation. The company was formerly known as ShouTi Inc. Structure Therapeutics Inc. was incorporated in 2016 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 218, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Raymond C.
