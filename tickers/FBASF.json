As of June 30, 2025, we remain the largest publicly traded real estate company in Mexico in terms of number of properties, annual revenue, and market capitalization, and we believe our portfolio represents one of the largest and highest-quality portfolios of industrial, commercial, and office properties in Mexico. Our objective is the creation of sustained, long-term value, primarily through the appreciation of our properties and the generation of stable cash flows. We achieve this by executing our strategy focused on maintaining a diversified portfolio, high occupancy rates, competitive rents, premium locations, and high-quality assets, all geared toward long-term relationships with our clients. We are a Mexican trust and conduct our business to qualify as a FIBRA in accordance with Articles 187 and 188 of the Mexican Income Tax Law (LISR). To qualify for tax purposes as a FIBRA, we must distribute at least 95% (ninety-five percent) of our taxable income annually, and at least 70% (seventy percent) of our assets must be invested in real estate and developments intended for lease, among other requirements. We conducted our initial public offering of CBFIs on March 18, 2011, raising approximately Ps. $3,584 million in gross proceeds, including the exercised over-allotment option (the \u0093Initial Offering\u0094). In connection with our Initial Offering, we completed formation transactions that consolidated our Initial Portfolio of 16 Properties and the Lease Rights of one Property (for a total of 17 Properties). We have also conducted three follow-on CBFI offerings totaling Ps. $63,743 million, which have provided us with the resources to continue our growth and further consolidate our Portfolio. We were established as a trust on January 10, 2011, in accordance with applicable law. Our registered office is located at Antonio Doval\u00ed Jaime No. 70, Tower B, 11Qh Floor, Col.
