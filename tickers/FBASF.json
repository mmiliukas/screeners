On June 29, 2019, Fibra UNO entered into a trustee substitution agreement effective July 1, 2019, appointing Banco Actinver SA, Instituci\u00f3n de Banca M\u00faltiple, Grupo Financiero Actinver (Actinver) as the new trustee of Fibra UNO Trust, replacing Deutsche Bank. The entity's name was changed to Fideicomiso Fibra UNO (Fibra UNO or the Entity). Fibra UNO began operations in March 2011 and was established primarily to acquire and own real estate properties for the purpose of leasing and developing commercial, industrial, and mixed-use properties, as well as office buildings and land, in the Mexican market. Fibra UNO, as a Real Estate Investment Trust (\u0093FIBRA\u0094), qualifies to be treated as a transparent entity in Mexico for purposes of the Income Tax Law (\u0093LISR\u0094). Therefore, all income and tax deductions generated by Fibra UNO's operations are attributed to the holders of its Real Estate Trust Certificates (\u0093CBFIs\u0094) for tax purposes and therefore Fibra UNO is not subject to Income Tax (\u0093ISR\u0094) in Mexico. In order to maintain the FIBRA's tax treatment, the Mexican Congress, through the Mexican Tax Administration Service (\u0093SAT\u0094), established, in Articles 187 and 188 of the LISR, that FIBRAs must annually distribute at least 95% of their net taxable income to the holders of outstanding CBFIs.", "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Andre  El-Mann Arazi", "age": 59, "title": "CEO & Director", "yearBorn": 1965, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Isidoro  Attie Laniado", "age": 54, "title": "Vice Chairman and Executive VP of Strategy & Finance", "yearBorn": 1970, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Fernando  Alvarez Toca", "age": 50, "title": "Vice President of Finance", "yearBorn": 1974, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Alfonso  Arceo Oregon", "age": 52, "title": "Vice President of Operations", "yearBorn": 1972, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Victor Ignacio Tortoriello Tortoriello", "age": 67, "title": "Vice President of Administration & IT", "yearBorn": 1957, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Jorge Humberto Pigeon Solorzano", "age": 55, "title": "Vice President of Capital Markets & Investor Relations", "yearBorn": 1969, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Alejandro  Chico Pizarro", "age": 49, "title": "VP of Legal Affairs & Secretary", "yearBorn": 1975, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Arturo  Campos", "title": "Director of Human Resources", "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Gonzalo Pedro Robina Ibarra", "age": 61, "title": "Deputy Chief Executive Officer", "yearBorn": 1963, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ana Karen Mora", "title": "Director of Sustainability", "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 1.46, "open": 1.4, "dayLow": 1.4, "dayHigh": 1.4, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 1.46, "regularMarketOpen": 1.4, "regularMarketDayLow": 1.4, "regularMarketDayHigh": 1.4, "dividendRate": 0.11, "dividendYield": 7.72, "exDividendDate": 1746662400, "payoutRatio": 0.7538, "fiveYearAvgDividendYield": 7.85, "trailingPE": 9.8, "volume": 100, "regularMarketVolume": 100, "averageVolume": 11348, "averageVolume10days": 4020, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 4020, "bid": 1.36, "ask": 1.46, "bidSize": 5900, "askSize": 450, "marketCap": 5593820160, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.96, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 1.49, "fiftyDayAverage": 1.39022, "twoHundredDayAverage": 1.1959785, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "profitMargins": 0.0, "sharesOutstanding": 3805319936, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.27695, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.19664, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 3987849984, "bookValue": 48.852, "priceToBook": 0.030090887, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1767139200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1751241600, "trailingEps": 0.15, "52WeekChange": 0.15294123, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.16932249, "lastDividendValue": 0.003, "lastDividendDate": 1731024000, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 1.47, "recommendationKey": "none", "revenuePerShare": 7.524, "grossMargins": 0.0, "ebitdaMargins": 0.0, "operatingMargins": 0.0, "financialCurrency": "MXN", "symbol": "FBASF", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Delayed Quote", "triggerable": false, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "LOW", "cryptoTradeable": false, "shortName": "Deutsche Bank Mexico SA Real Es", "longName": "Fibra UNO", "averageDailyVolume3Month": 11348, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChange": 0.51000005, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChangePercent": 0.53125006, "fiftyTwoWeekRange": "0.96 -
