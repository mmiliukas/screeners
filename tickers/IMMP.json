The company is involved in advancing therapeutics related to Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3 (LAG-3), a cell surface molecule that plays a vital role in regulating the immune system. Its LAG-3 immunotherapies are designed to harness and strengthen the power of patients' immune systems to fight cancer and autoimmune disease. Its lead product candidate is eftilagimod alpha (efti or IMP321) for the treatment of different types of cancers. The trials that efi is being evaluated in include TACTI-002, a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); TACTI-003, a Phase IIb clinical trial to treat HNSCC; and INSIGHT-003, a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of NSCLC, as well as INSIGHT-005, a Phase I/IIa clinical trial to treat solid tumors. In addition, it offers IMP761, an agonist of lymphocyte activation gene 3 for autoimmune disease; IMP701, an antagonist antibody that acts to stimulate T cell proliferation in cancer patients; and IMP731, a depleting antibody that removes T cells involved in autoimmunity. The company has collaboration agreements with GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, CYTLIMIC Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Institute of Clinical Cancer Research, Merck KGaA, and EOC Pharma. The company was formerly known as Prima BioMed Ltd and changed its name to Immutep Limited in November 2017. The company was incorporated in 1987 and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia.", "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Marc  Voigt", "age": 50, "title": "CEO, MD, CFO, Chief Business Officer & Executive Director", "yearBorn": 1973, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 372245, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Deanne  Miller LLB", "age": 46, "title": "COO, General Counsel & Joint Company Secretary", "yearBorn": 1977, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 243430, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Frederic  Triebel M.D., Ph.D.", "age": 68, "title": "Chief Scientific Officer & Executive Director", "yearBorn": 1955, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 297154, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Christian  Mueller BBA, MSc.", "title": "Senior Vice President of Regulatory & Strategy", "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Florian D.
