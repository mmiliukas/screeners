The company offers High Velocity Therapy systems, such as HVT 2.0, Precision Flow Hi-VNI, Precision Flow Plus, and Precision Flow Classic which delivers non-invasive ventilatory support to patients by providing heated, humidified, and oxygenated air at a high velocity to treat patients through a small-bore nasal interface. It also provides companion products, including Vapotherm Transfer Unit, which allows patients to be transferred between care areas within the hospital or ambulate while on therapy; Q50 compressor that provides compressed air necessary to run the precision flow systems in areas of the hospital without access to a wall gas source; aerosol aeroneb adaptor to facilitate delivery of aerosolized solutions; aerosol disposable patient circuit that is designed to streamline the provision of continuous and intermittent delivery of aerosol solutions for patients; and tracheostomy adaptors that simplifies the connection of the High Velocity Therapy systems to a tracheostomy collar used to wean patients off mechanical ventilation. In addition, the company offers ProSoft cannula to provide gentle contact with the skin; and disposable products comprising single-use disposables and nasal interfaces, as well as Oxygen Assist Module, which helps clinicians maintain oxygen levels within a target range.
