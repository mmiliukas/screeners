In August 2022, the Company acquired Cedar Realty Trust. As a result of that acquisition, Cedar became a subsidiary of the Company. As of June 30, 2025, the Company, through the Operating Partnership, owned and operated sixty-nine properties, including sixty-six retail shopping centers and three undeveloped properties in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Maryland and West Virginia. This list includes the properties acquired through the Cedar Acquisition. The Company's portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions, and is geographically concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast, which markets represent approximately 46%, 44% and 10% respectively, of the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of June 30, 2025. The Company's geographic concentration may cause it to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. Additionally, the Company's retail shopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants.", "fullTimeEmployees": 56, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Michael Andrew Franklin", "age": 43, "title": "CEO & President", "yearBorn": 1981, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 644626, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Rebecca  Schiefer", "title": "Director of Accounting", "fiscalYear": 2024, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Ms. Victoria H.
