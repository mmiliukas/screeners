The company provides sequencing systems; consumable products, including single molecule real-time (SMRT) technology; long-red sequencing; and various reagent kits designed for specific workflow, such as preparation kit to convert DNA into SMRTbell double-stranded DNA library formats, including molecular biology reagents, such as ligase, buffers, and exonucleases. It also offers binding kits, such as modified DNA polymerase used to bind SMRTbell libraries to the polymerase in preparation for sequencing; and sequencing kits comprise reagents required for on-instrument, real-time sequencing, including the phospholinked nucleotides. In addition, it provides revio system + sequel systems which conduct, monitor, and analyze single-molecule biochemical reactions in real time; SBB short-read sequencing; onso instrument conducts, monitors, and analyzes SBB biochemical reactions; and SBB consumable, including flow cells, clustering, and sequencing reagent kits. The company serves academic and governmental research institutions; commercial testing and service laboratories; genome centers; public health labs, hospitals and clinical research institutes, and contract research organizations; pharmaceutical companies; and agricultural companies. It markets its products through a sales force and distribution partners in Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. It has a development and commercialization agreement with Invitae Corporation; and a collaboration with Radboud University Medical to explore genetic causes of rare and genetic diseases. The company was formerly known as Nanofluidics, Inc. and changed its name to Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. in 2005. Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. was incorporated in 2000 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California.", "fullTimeEmployees": 796, "auditRisk": 6, "boardRisk": 3, "compensationRisk": 6, "shareHolderRightsRisk": 3, "overallRisk": 4, "governanceEpochDate": 1717200000, "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 1.57, "open": 1.57, "dayLow": 1.46, "dayHigh": 1.61, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 1.57, "regularMarketOpen": 1.57, "regularMarketDayLow": 1.46, "regularMarketDayHigh": 1.61, "beta": 2.006, "forwardPE": -2.0136986, "volume": 10714189, "regularMarketVolume": 10714189, "averageVolume": 10436966, "averageVolume10days": 6539820, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 6539820, "bid": 1.45, "ask": 1.48, "bidSize": 1500, "askSize": 3000, "marketCap": 400363328, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 1.25, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 14.55, "priceToSalesTrailing12Months": 1.9975119, "fiftyDayAverage": 1.8558, "twoHundredDayAverage": 5.83775, "currency": "USD", "enterpriseValue": 769815168, "profitMargins": -1.4813, "floatShares": 270893341, "sharesOutstanding": 272356000, "sharesShort": 56581081, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 48520230, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1713139200, "dateShortInterest": 1715731200, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.2077, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.01853, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.94704, "shortRatio": 3.56, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.2393, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 285367008, "bookValue": 2.384, "priceToBook": 0.6166107, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1703980800, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1711843200, "netIncomeToCommon": -296897984, "trailingEps": -1.14, "forwardEps": -0.73, "pegRatio": 1.71, "enterpriseToRevenue": 3.841, "enterpriseToEbitda": -2.725, "52WeekChange": -0.8839779, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.26238096, "exchange": "NMS", "quoteType": "EQUITY", "symbol": "PACB", "underlyingSymbol": "PACB", "shortName": "Pacific Biosciences of Californ", "longName": "Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.", "firstTradeDateEpochUtc": 1288186200, "timeZoneFullName": "America/New_York", "timeZoneShortName": "EDT", "uuid": "afbf9e1c-8320-3cad-8278-ee8ce023e356", "messageBoardId": "finmb_11461617", "gmtOffSetMilliseconds": -14400000, "currentPrice": 1.47, "targetHighPrice": 8.0, "targetLowPrice": 2.0, "targetMeanPrice": 3.33, "targetMedianPrice": 3.0, "recommendationMean": 2.3, "recommendationKey": "buy", "numberOfAnalystOpinions": 12, "totalCash": 561913984, "totalCashPerShare": 2.063, "ebitda": -282536992, "totalDebt": 931366016, "quickRatio": 8.118, "currentRatio": 9.281, "totalRevenue": 200431008, "debtToEquity": 143.504, "revenuePerShare": 0.769, "returnOnAssets": -0.108430006, "returnOnEquity": -0.44276002, "freeCashflow": -304229120, "operatingCashflow": -240164000, "revenueGrowth": -0.002, "grossMargins": 0.30375, "ebitdaMargins": -1.40965, "operatingMargins": -2.09822, "financialCurrency": "USD", "trailingPegRatio": null, "__fetch_time": "2024-06-24"}]
