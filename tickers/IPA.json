The company owns an integrated end-to-end suite of capabilities to support the development of therapeutic antibodies and are known for solving industry challenges. It provides NonaVac DNA for complex protein classes, including GPCRs and ion channels; and Rapid Prime, positive monoclonal antibodies for generating anti-idiotypic antibodies, and producing monoclonal antibodies against conformational epitopes. The company also offers syngeneic cell line for immunization and screening; peptide production for subsequent antibody discovery campaign; B cell select platform, which allows for the interrogation of animal antibody repertoire; screening of the immune repertoire of rabbits and chickens and desired antibody directly from the B cells; single step hybridoma, a semi-solid media to grow mouse and rat hybridomas; and DeepDisplay, a combination of transgenic animal platform and custom IPA phage display antibody selection. In addition, it provides phage display, a custom immune library; CAR development, an adaptable antibody, which allows the inclusion of functional data early in the screening funnel; antibody sequencing; and assay development. Further, it offers a profiling toolset for antibody lead candidates; and in vitro analytical tools for the study of quality attributes. Additionally, it provides LucinaTech, an antibody humanization to identify framework and CDR residues; antibody affinity maturation for therapeutic and diagnostic application; antibody chimerization for cloning and production of antibody domain; Eurofins preclinical services; hybrid service model designed to reduce time and risk with custom applications; breadth and depth to accelerate assay development, screening cascades, drug candidate validation, and new biotherapeutic concepts; and protein manufacturing services.
