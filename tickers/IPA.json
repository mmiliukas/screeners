The company owns an integrated end-to-end suite of capabilities to support the development of therapeutic antibodies. It provides NonaVac DNA for complex protein classes, including GPCRs and ion channels; and Rapid Prime, positive monoclonal antibodies for generating anti-idiotypic antibodies, and producing monoclonal antibodies against conformational epitopes. The company also offers syngeneic cell line for immunization and screening; peptide production for subsequent antibody discovery campaign; B cell select platform, which allows for the interrogation of animal antibody repertoire; screening of the immune repertoire of rabbits and chickens and desired antibody directly from the B cells; single step hybridoma, a semi-solid media to grow mouse and rat hybridomas; and DeepDisplay, a combination of transgenic animal platform and custom IPA phage display antibody selection. In addition, it provides phage display, a custom immune library; CAR development, an adaptable antibody, which allows the inclusion of functional data early in the screening funnel; antibody sequencing; and assay development. Further, it offers a profiling toolset for antibody lead candidates; and in vitro analytical tools for the study of quality attributes. Additionally, it provides LucinaTech, an antibody humanization to identify framework and CDR residues; antibody affinity maturation for therapeutic and diagnostic application; antibody chimerization for cloning and production of antibody domain; Eurofins preclinical services; hybrid service model designed to reduce time and risk with custom applications; breadth and depth to accelerate assay development, screening cascades, drug candidate validation, and new biotherapeutic concepts; and protein manufacturing services.
